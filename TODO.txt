* Make a frame class that is similar to a boid but self draw axes using QLineItem added to QGraphicsScene

* Mouse scroll wheel zoom and right mouse button pan

* Left mouse button to select an entity

* Make entity info panel that is a child of the entity. Just like the debug line

* Make all settings apply on change

* Rather than having a hardcoded steering force, use a PID controller to drive the boids to a position
